Development of the CS 225 Final Project

Week of 11/23/20

This week, we set up the initial files for the project. We copied the files from lab_ml representing a basic graph structure for use in our own project. We also used the Makefile framework from the Final Project Demo on Github. In the interests of dividing the work equally amongst our group's members, we have created individual files for the three major algorithms that we will be creating, namely the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm, Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm, and the Landmark Path algorithm.
